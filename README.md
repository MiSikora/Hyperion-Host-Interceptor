# Hyperion Host Interceptor

A [Hyperion](https://github.com/willowtreeapps/Hyperion-Android) plugin that allows you to change the host of [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp) client from the debug menu.

## Integration

This library requires Java 8 bytecode. To enable Java 8 desugaring configure it in your Gradle script.

```groovy
android {
  compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
  }
  // For Kotlin projects
  kotlinOptions {
    jvmTarget = "1.8"
  }
}
```

To integrate it with your app you need to add a dependency on this plugin to your project and add `HostInterceptor` to your `OkHttp` client.

```groovy
debugImplementation "io.mehow.hyperion:hyperion-host-interceptor:0.2.0"
debugImplementation "com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-core:$HyperionCurrentVersion"
```

```kotlin
Environment.init(
    context,
    Environment("QA", "https://www.qa.com".toHttpUrl()),
    Environment("STAGING", "https://www.staging.com".toHttpUrl()),
    Environment("RELEASE", "https://www.release.com".toHttpUrl())
)
val interceptor = HostInterceptor(context)
val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
    .addInterceptor(interceptor)
    .build()
```

Environments should be initialized before Hyperion initializes its plugins. The best place for it is the `Application` object. Check [the sample](sample/) for more information.
